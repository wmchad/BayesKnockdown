Description: A simple, fast Bayesian method for computing posterior
	     probabilities for relationships between a single predictor variable
	     and multiple potential outcome variables, incorporating prior
	     probabilities of relationships. In the context of knockdown
	     experiments, the predictor variable is the knocked-down gene, while
	     the other genes are potential targets. Can also be used for
	     differential expression/2-class data.
