This document illustrates the use of the {\tt BayesKnockdwon} R
package to calculate posterior probabilities of relationships between
a single predictor and multiple potential targets. The package was
developed specifically for gene expression datasets in the form of
knockdown experiments, but can be applied more generally.

\section{Posterior Probabilities}
Given a predictor $x$ and a set of possible targets $y$, the
\texttt{BayesKnockdown} function can be invoked to estimate the
posterior probabilities of a relationship between $x$ and each
individual target in $y$ (Young et~al. 2016). The
\texttt{BayesKnockdown} function allows specification of a prior
probability of regulation via the \texttt{prior} argument, and it can
be a constant for all targets or unique to each target. This is useful
particularly when an informative prior is available to incorporate
additional knowledge. The prior is set to 0.5 by default, which
corresponds to an uninformative prior.

Additionally, the method allows specification of Zellner's $g$-prior
via the \texttt{g} argument. The $g$-prior specifies the expected
strength of the signal relative to noise, with larger values
corresponding to a larger expected signal. It is recommended that $g$
be set to a value between 1 and the number of observations in the
data. The default value is $\sqrt{n}$, which we have found to be a
good compromise between the extremes

\subsection{Simulated Data Example}

As a simple example of using the \texttt{BayesKnockdown} function, we
generate random data for the knockdown gene as well as the potential
targets. We then introduce a relationship between the knockdown gene
and target number 3. The \texttt{BayesKnockdown} function takes this
data and produces the posterior probability of a relationship between
$x$ and each target. Figure \ref{fig:simPlot} shows the posterior
probabilities calculated for each target.

<<SimulatedEx>>=
library(BayesKnockdown);
set.seed(1618);
n <- 100;
p <- 10;
x <- rnorm(n);
y <- matrix(nrow=p, data=rnorm(n*p));
y[3,] <- y[3,] + 0.5*x;

simResult <- BayesKnockdown(x, y);

barplot(simResult, names.arg="", xlab="Target Gene",
        ylab="Posterior Probability", ylim=c(0,1));

  \caption{Bar plot showing the posterior probabilities of a
    relationship between the knockdown gene and each target in
    simulated data. Gene 3 is the only true relationship.}
  \label{fig:simPlot}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Knockdown Data Example}

A more concrete example uses data from the National Institute of
Health (NIH) Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures
(LINCS) program (\url{http://lincsproject.org}) \cite{Duan14}. The aim
of this program is to generate genetic and molecular signatures of
cells in response to various perturbations. To support this endeavor,
many large datasets have been made available, including proteomic and
imaging data.

The LINCS L1000 data captures gene expression levels of 1,000 genes in
human cell lines under a variety of conditions. The \texttt{lincs.kd}
data is a 21 by 27 matrix containing data from knockdown experiments
targeting gene PPARG in cell line A375. The first row is the
expression levels of PPARG in 27 different experiments, while the
other rows are a subset of the measured genes in the same
experiments. The data has been normalized to account for differences
in the experimental settings, as described in \cite{Young2016}. The
full LINCS L1000 data is available at \url{http://lincscloud.org}.

Given the L1000 data, the \texttt{BayesKnockdown} function can be
invoked to calculate the posterior probabilities of a relationship
between gene PPARG and the other genes in the dataset. In this case,
we specify a prior of 0.0005, reflecting the belief that there are
very few relationships relative to the total possible number. Figure
\ref{fig:kdPlot} shows the range of values returned for the different
target genes.

<<KnockdownEx>>=
data(lincs.kd);
kdResult <- BayesKnockdown(lincs.kd[1,], lincs.kd[-1,], prior=0.0005);
barplot(kdResult, names.arg="", xlab="Target Gene",
        ylab="Posterior Probability", ylim=c(0,1));
@ 
\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{kdPlot.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Bar plot showing the posterior probabilities of a
    relationship between the knockdown gene PPARG and each target in
    LINCS L1000 data.}
  \label{fig:simPlot}
\end{figure}

\section{2-Class Data}
The \texttt{BayesKnockdown.diffExp} function tests for differential
expression in a set of variables between two experimental
conditions. In gene expression data, this often takes the form of
comparing the effects of a drug perturbation compared to a
baseline. Of interest is the set of genes which show different
expression levels between the two conditions. The
\texttt{BayesKnockdown.diffExp} function takes two matrices of
observations for a set of variables, one matrix for each condition,
and gives posterior probabilities that the variables are different
between the two conditions.

As an example, we generate two random datasets for 10 genes,
corresponding to different experimental conditions. The first
has 25 observations and the second has 30. We add an offset for gene 3
in the second dataset, reflecting a change of expression between the
two conditions. The \texttt{BayesKnockdown.diffExp} function produces
posterior probabilities for each gene reflecting how likely they are
to be expressed differently between the two conditions. Figure
\ref{fig:diffExpPlot} shows the posterior probabilities that each gene
is differentially expressed between the two conditions.

<<BayesKnockdown.diffExp>>=
n1 <- 25;
n2 <- 30;
p <- 10;
y1 <- matrix(nrow=p, data=rnorm(n1*p));
y2 <- matrix(nrow=p, data=rnorm(n2*p));
y2[3,] <- y2[3,] + 1;

diffExpResult <- BayesKnockdown.diffExp(y1, y2);

barplot(diffExpResult, names.arg="", xlab="Target Gene",
        ylab="Posterior Probability", ylim=c(0,1));

  \caption{Bar plot showing the posterior probabilities of 
    relationship between the knockdown gene and each target in
    simulated data. Gene 3 is the only true relationship.}
